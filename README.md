The Otan mektep complex is designed to improve the safety level of schools, children's sports facilities and other children's institutions. Provides parents online with reliable information about their childrenâ€™s visits to these institutions, ensures accounting and control of the working hours of teaching staff and service personnel.

Allows you to integrate installed video surveillance systems and identify unauthorized persons, including persons wanted for committing crimes against children, or prone to such offenses. It has the functions of identifying and preventing terrorist threats, the ability to identify persons with weapons, and includes the Panic Button subsystem.

The access control system supplied as part of the Complex is designed to ensure the safety of educational institutions from penetration by unauthorized persons with integrated functions to combat the spread of COVID-19.

The access control system identifies incoming persons using smart terminals with built-in sensors (reading magnetic cards and facial identification), checks whether visitors are wearing a mask and automatically measures their temperature. If a mask is missing or a visitor has a high temperature, the system prohibits him from entering the establishment.

At the same time, all identified persons (by their IIN) are checked online in the database of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan to determine their COVID-19 status and, if the status is determined as infected or contact persons, the system does not allow them to enter institutions, submits beeps and issues a warning to the security post. Based on the results of all checks, the visitor is granted or denied access by sending signals to the actuating devices - turnstiles.
